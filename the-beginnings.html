The game was created by William Higinbotham, a nuclear physicist.People lined up for miles at the Brookhaven National Laboratory to play Tennis for Two, which involved players using knobs and buttons to hit the ball and customize the angle at which it was hit at.</h4>

Unlike Tennis for Two, the game’s visuals were not completely displayed on screen, instead users had to use physical overlay’s to detail the game's action.

<h4 align = "center" >The Father of Video Games, Ralph Baer was born in Germany and emigrated to America as a child in 1938. Bear earned his title as the Father of Video Games when he invented the “Brown Box” which has features that consoles still use today. The Brown Box featured two controls and a multigame program system, as mentioned before that is still used today. Players could play a plethora of games by flipping the switches that were spread out across the front of the box such as ping-pong, checkers, etc. Safe to say, it changed the way consoles were manufactured forever.
