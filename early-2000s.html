<hr/>
<h4 align = "center" > The 2000s saw a lot of development especially for handheld consoles. Playstation still reigned supreme with their second release of the console which would be the 1st ever console to use digital versatile disc. They also advanced in the handheld line with the Portable Playstation or PSP. However, Nintendo still held the crown for handheld consoles despite Sony's strong attempts. In the early 2000s, they came out with three devices. The 32-bit Advance Gameboy in 2001, the Gameboy Advance Sp in 2003 and finally their first ever dual screen consoles named after its design, the Nintendo DS in 2004. Nintendo would also get their hand in the deck with the Wii release in 2006. This console placed them back at the top along with the Playstation  3 and Xbox 360 due to its unique active aspect with gaming. The Xbox 360, released the year before in 2005 held popularity due to it's online gaming ecosystem and it's hardware also featured a built in ethernet port with a 20 Gigabyte hard drive.  </h4>
